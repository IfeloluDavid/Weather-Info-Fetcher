**Project Title: Weather Info Fetcher**

Objective: Create a serverless function that fetches and displays current weather information for a given city using a public weather API.

🔍 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:

1️⃣ A static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket acts as the user interface, where users enter the name of a city.

2️⃣ The request is routed through an API Gateway, serving as the bridge between the user and backend.

3️⃣ A Lambda function is triggered, fetching the current weather information from OpenWeatherMap's public API.

4️⃣ The result? Instant weather updates delivered back to the user! 🌎🌧️🌞

## Features
- Accepts a city name from the frontend.
- Retrieves real-time weather information such as temperature and description.
- Displays the information in a user-friendly interface.
- Uses AWS serverless architecture for seamless scalability.

## Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: To set up Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.
- **Node.js & npm**: For testing and deployment.
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an API key.
- **Basic knowledge of AWS services**.

## Steps to Build the Project

### 1. Set Up OpenWeatherMap API
1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Sign up or log in and generate an API key.
3. Keep the API key handy; you'll need it for the Lambda function.

---

### 2. Create the Backend with AWS Lambda
1. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Navigate to **Lambda** → **Create Function**.
   - Choose **Author from Scratch**.
   - Function Name: `weatherInfoFetcher`.
   - Runtime: **Python 3.9**.

2. **Write the Lambda Code**: Which is Part of the Files in the Repository

3. **Deploy the Lambda Function**:
   - Save and deploy the function.

4. **Test the Lambda Function**:
   - Test with the following `event`:
     ```json
     {
       "queryStringParameters": {
         "city": "London"
       }
     }
     ```

---

### 3. Configure API Gateway
1. **Create an API Gateway**:
   - Navigate to **API Gateway** → **Create API**.
   - Choose **HTTP API**.

2. **Configure Routes**:
   - Add a new route: `GET /Implementation`.
   - Integrate this route with your Lambda function.

3. **Deploy the API**:
   - Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., `prod`).
   - Note the API endpoint.

---

### 4. Create the Frontend
1. Create an `index.html` file with the file used

   Replace YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL with your actual API Gateway URL.

Save the file.


Replace YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL with your actual API Gateway URL.

Save the file.

**5. Host the Frontend**
Use AWS S3:

Create an S3 bucket.
Upload the index.html file.
Enable static website hosting.
Access the Frontend:

Use the S3 website URL to access your frontend.

**6. Testing**
Open your frontend in a browser.
Enter a city name and click "Fetch Weather".
Verify the displayed weather information.
Additional Notes
Ensure CORS is enabled in API Gateway.
Make sure your Lambda function has proper permissions.
For production, secure the API Gateway with authentication.
