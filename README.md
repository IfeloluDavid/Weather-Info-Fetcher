**Project Title: Weather Info Fetcher**

Objective: Create a serverless function that fetches and displays current weather information for a given city using a public weather API.

🔍 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:

1️⃣ A static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket acts as the user interface, where users enter the name of a city.

2️⃣ The request is routed through an API Gateway, serving as the bridge between the user and backend.

3️⃣ A Lambda function is triggered, fetching the current weather information from OpenWeatherMap's public API.

4️⃣ The result? Instant weather updates delivered back to the user! 🌎🌧️🌞
